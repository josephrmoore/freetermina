		        	<h1>Enough! We Want the Hylians Out of Power!</h1>
		        	<p>The lush, rich, ample Golden Lands of Termina have nourished our brothers and sisters, our fathers and their fathers, for generations on end. No matter what race, tribe, or group you come from Termina Field has always been a home for anyone who needs it. But sadly, not any longer.</p>
		        	<p>Since the Hylian Occupation began, countless tribes have been driven further and further from the lands that nourished them. The results of the increasing Hylian Settlements have pushed most of them into decline, where not outright driving them to extinction. We need only remember the Kokiri for proof of that.</p>
		        	<p>But we are not like them. We do not put ourselves above them like they do over everyone else. We want to co-exist with the Hylians, as the Giants always meant for us to do. But before that can happen they MUST stop their war of cultural supremacy against the rest of the world.</p>
		        	<p>This is what we believe:</p>
		        	<ul class="heart-list">
		        		<li>
		        		The Four Giants, in Their melancholy and weariness, laid down the foundations of the world and handed the reins over to the First Four races equally.
		        		</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We believe that the Giants intend for us to share dominion of the world with all the races that inhabit it.
			        	</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We will fight, die, and do anything in our power to achieve this. The Giants are good.

		        <div class="history">
			        <h1>The Unwritten History of "Hyrule"</h1>
			        <p>According to known Hylian history, The Goddess Hylia was left in charge of a portion of this world some time after the Giants laid the Foundations. Her people, the Hylians, lived in Termina for generations, though a name for the place before The Exile is not recorded anywhere in Hylian history.</p>
			        <blockquote>
			        For an age, Hylia ruled over the then-unnamed land that was then known only as "the Surface," presiding over the various races in the world at that time. 
			        </blockquote>
			        <p>This sounds unlikely, for one, because "The Surface" is a name that only makes sense when looking down on the world from the sky. Clearly, this is the name for the world that the Hylians coined, only later, when they were in exile in the sky.</p>
			        <p>One possibility is that the name was lost over the ages. A likely and completely plausible scenario. Another possibility is that the name was recorded, but that Hylian historians don't want you to know what that name is. But I want you to know. It was Termina.</p>
			        <p>I know this because every other tribe race and clan throughout the world called it Termina. If the Hylians were truly masters of the world as they say, then it must have been them that disseminated this name to the other races to begin with. If not, it is a name that reminds that Hylians that they didn't always live here.</p>
			        <p>But whatever it was called, it is without question that in the beginning, the Hylians lived here in Termina with us all. But it didn't last. Soon a great war engulfed the entire land.</p>
			        <blockquote>A fissure opened in the earth, connecting the underground to the Surface. From this fissure poured an army of demons led by their ruler, the Demon King known as Demise.</blockquote>
			        <p>According to Hylian lore, The Great Demon King Demise was the cause of the Great War that sent the Hylians into exile. However, histories from the Gorons, Zora, and Kokiri (before their extinction) tell us that a great number of other factors were at play leading to nearly every tribe on the face of Termina to take arms up against each other for one reason or another. Certainly the appearance of Demise and his forces from Below exacerbated the situation greatly and led to a much bloodier conflict than we would have seen otherwise. But the truth is, the Hylian population was already beginning to chafe at its boundaries, leading to skirmishes with several of the surrounding tribes. Had they been able to stay in balance with the world Demise wouldn't have found so many ready and willing allies, and he'd never have been able to get a foothold in our world.</p>
			        <p>But gain a foothold he did, and Termina burned. The Hylians were under threat from all sides and with little other choice, Hylia sent her people into exile in the sky. The Hylians lived above it all for millenia. But after the defeat of Demise at the hands of the Skyward Hero, the Hylian people returned to Termina, re-christening it Hyrule, and claiming it all for themselves. Perhaps it was the time in exile led them to forget their origins, as one piece of a much more elaborate and beautiful puzzle, or perhaps they had just finally come to know themselves enough to admit what they wanted, total control and domination.</p>
			        <p>You may have noticed that what is not recorded in Hylian history is the fates of the races and tribes of this world while the Hylians were exiled to the sky. The reason is that it would be too damaging to Hylian morale, and luckily for them, you can't find it all in one place. Each of the peoples of Termina keep their own account of the ages, and you'd have to show them all enough respect to gain access to them. Something the Hylians seem to have a hard time with.</p>
			        <p>However, historians in the Free Termina movement have been starting to compile these books, accounts of The Return and the bloody war that led to the founding of Hyrule Castle. The tale of how the Gorons lost stewardship over the Golden Lands, and even the exact details in the extinction of the Kokiri. True Termina history has never before been available to the people, but thanks to the work we're doing to recover, translate, and compile numerous non-Hylian sources there will soon be a place to get a bigger picture, a truer picture, of this land and the multitudes of different peoples in it.</p>

		        	<h1>I'm Ready to Fight! What Can I Do?</h1>
		        	<p>Terminians of all races and powers are already standing up to the cruel, illegal, and interminian methods the Hylian Army uses to intimidate, bully, and eventually marginalize every other race in our world. But if you are ready to do more, and we need all the help we can get, there are any number of ways you can contribute to the resistance. While it's dangerous to go alone, Hylian spies are everywhere and they outmatch us in every conceivable way, including supposed possession of the complete Triforce, by working together we can make a difference, take a stand, and take back what belongs to all of us. Termina. The Giants are Good.</p>
		        	<p>Whatever your strengths, we will need them. Find us anywhere antihyliac virtues are praised, and we will find you.</p>

		        	<p>Worry no longer! Each issue of What THEY Say takes a razor sharp look at the ridiculous lies the Hylians tell to try and win this war with misinformation.</p>

		        	<p>Hylians claim their ridiculous pointy ears allow them to "hear the messages of the gods". A convenient way to tell someone else to do what you want, for sure, but you don't have to be left out any longer! Get Pointy Ears and now you can hear what the Gods are saying too. Infused with a secret Hylian magic, each set of pointy ears lets you not only look cool, but boss everyone around while you do it.</p>

		        	<p>No question, Ganondorf was a bad bad guy, but even though his methods were extreme you might be surprised that he wasn't only motivated by evil.</p>
		        	<p>In <i>Rise of Ganon</i> famed Gerudo filmmaker Aveil Bastille explores the real reasons behind Ganondorf's quest to conquer Hyrule and the undiscovered truth behind why everything went so wrong in the end. While Hylian apologists would lead you to believe that their "Hero" was doing what needed to be done to "save the world" <i>Rise of Ganon</i> will point to questions that will haunt you, leading you to consider if maybe everything you've been told is a lie.</p>
