		        	<h1>Enough! We Want the Hylians Out of Power!</h1>
		        	<p>The lush, rich, ample Golden Lands of Termina have nourished our brothers and sisters, our fathers and their fathers, for generations on end. No matter what race, tribe, or group you come from Termina Field has always been a home for anyone who needs it. But sadly, not any longer.</p>
		        	<p>Since the Hylian Occupation began, countless tribes have been driven further and further from the lands that nourished them. The results of the increasing Hylian Settlements have pushed most of them into decline, where not outright driving them to extinction. We need only remember the Kokiri for proof of that.</p>
		        	<p>But we are not like them. We do not put ourselves above them like they do over everyone else. We want to co-exist with the Hylians, as the Giants always meant for us to do. But before that can happen they MUST stop their war of cultural supremacy against the rest of the world.</p>
		        	<p>This is what we believe:</p>
		        	<ul>
		        		<li>
		        		The Four Giants, in Their melancholy and weariness, laid down the foundations of the world and handed the reins over to the First Four races equally.
		        		</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We believe that the Giants intend for us to share dominion of the world with all the races that inhabit it.
			        	</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We will fight, die, and do anything in our power to achieve this. The Giants are good.
			        	</li>

			        <h1>The Unwritten History of "Hyrule"</h1>
			        <p>According to known Hylian history, The Goddess Hylia was left in charge of a portion of this world some time after the Giants laid the Foundations. Her people, the Hylians, lived in Termina for generations, though a name for the place before The Exile is not recorded anywhere in Hylian history. Outside of the Hylian lands, however, a great agitator was stirring up tensions and the world quickly devolved into a state of conflict. A conflict so great that Hylia took her people into the sky and let them live there for centuries. After the defeat of Demise at the hands of the Skyward Hero, the Hylian people returned to Termina, re-christening it Hyrule, and claiming it all for themselves.</p>
			        <p>What is not recorded in Hylian history is what happened to the races and tribes of this world while they were In Exile in the sky. The reason is that it would be too damaging to Hylian morale, and luckily for them, you can't get it all in one place. Each of the peoples of Termina keep their own account of the ages, and you'd have to show them all enough respect to gain access to them. Something the Hylians seem to have a hard time with.</p>
			        <p>However, historians in the Free Termina movement have been starting to compile these books, accounts of The Return and the bloody war that led to the founding of Hyrule Castle. The tale of how the Gorons lost stewardship over the Golden Lands, and even the exact details in the extinction of the Kokiri.</p>
			        <p>True Termina history has never before been available to the people, but now it will be very soon. Check back here for the latest on this project as it develops.</p>
