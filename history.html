			        	<h1>A Land of Ice and Water</h1>
			        	<h2>The Zoras: The Taking of the Lake and Relocation to their "Domain"</h2>
			        	<p>One of the most prominant features of Occupied Termina is the grand and majestic sight of Lake Hylia. A namesake of its people, the Lake is a proud symbol of the life, fertility, and beauty these Golden Lands of Termina have to offer. But as you may have wondered, the Hylians are not an aquatic race, nor are they especially fearsome or skilled on the water. How and why then does this Great Lake bear their name?</p>
			        	<p>It may not surprise you to learn that before the Occupation, the Lake was not called Lake Hylia, but in fact, Lake Zora. It was the crown jewel of Zora culture. It is a beauty now to be seen, but in its height, the Zoras had outdone themselves in displaying the sleek sophistication and advanced aquatic technology their people were famed for. A vast city complex ran throughout the entire lake and even extend above in places, so that visitors from the land could enter and see the city from the inside. So famed, lush, and gorgeous a place, Lake Zora was a sight travelers came from leagues away to see. So famed, that it was almost immediately made a target by the Hylians when they descended upon the land and calling everything that was long there before them, theirs.</p>
			        	<p>When the Hylians returned from the sky, they came from every corner of the land, falling from the sky like some kind of gift or perhaps pestilence from The Giants. The Zoras were one of the races that fought them the hardest, having an aptitude and strong drive for warfare. Also, at that moment, the Zora culture was on an upswing and everywhere they were beginning to assert a little more dominence, trying to show off in from of all the other races with their grandeur. But even the Zoras were no match for the Hylians, aided as they were with the might of the Triforce. The Zoras retreated to Lake Zora and prepared to make their last stand.</p>
			        	<p>The Hylian generals had decided to take the Lake City as a prize and warning to the other races that were openly defying their Occupation of their lands. Meanwhile, the entire Zora force fell back and fortified the city preparing for a massive showdown. And they were not disappointed. Hylian forces surrounded the lake with a force so large the Zoras had never seen anything like it. They prepared to fight when the Hylians offered peace for the Zoras if they would just relocate to a small sanctuary the Hylians had discovered not far from the central settlement. Of course the Zoras ignored this and prepared for battle.</p>
			        	<p>And when the battle begun, The Zoras believed they had a chance to defend their proud city, their citadel of culture, the pride of their peoples' accomplishments. But as the battle began, the Hylians didn't attack the Zoras rushing at them, they fought just to destroy the infrastructure of the town itself. Before long the foundations began to creak and the entire Lake Zora city collapsed, killing over 80% of the Zora population, most of them non-fighting civilians, females, or eggs.</p>
			        	<p>In the face of such brutality the Zoras immediately surrendered, placing themselves at the Hylians' mercy, fully expecting to receive none. However, they were surpirsed. The Hylians kept their word honoring the original deal, transporting the remaining Zora population to this small outcropping of water near the site of the future Hyrule Castle, thus establishing their home at "Zora's Domain". And while it seems like an honorable way to treat an enemy, Zora historians later noted that the resources needed by the original Zora population was more than four times what would have been possible under the best of conditions in Zora's domain. Either the Hylians had planned to level the city anyway, thus reducing the population to a level where it was possible to survive in The Domain. Or, they had just planned to let them starve each other out, fighting for what resources were available. Either way, the Hylians at no time had any plans to allow for the possibility of peace with the Zoras, only content with eliminating them as a threat and competition, while also keeping them close enough to look after in a place where it would be impossible for their numbers to grow too big.</p>

			        	<h1>Once and Future Guardians</h1>
			        	<h2>The Gorons: The Role They Once Played and Why They Will Again</h2>
			        	<p>Before the Hylian Occupation, there was a different system of law and order in Termina. The Gorons, a race much stronger, but slower, steadier, and with an inherent sense fo justice, had always stood up for the rights and welfare of others since the beginnings of Termina itself. In fact, some believe that the first Goron was in fact a descendant of one of the Four Giants. And before The Occupation, that is what they did. The Gorons were judges, adjucating disagreements between people, tribes, and races. Many wars were averted thanks to the wisdom and counsel of the Great Goron Council.</p>
			        	<p>However, when the Hylians began to spread across the land, not even the Gorons were able to settle and treat with them. The head Goron Judge at the time was recorded as saying, "We can no longer do that which we've done for time immemorial, these Hylians will not listen to anyone but their own." And it wasn't long after that the Gorons sent word to every tribe taht they would no longer be playing a role in Terminian Society and would retreat for their own species preservation to Death Mountain, where only the most courageous would be able to find them and seek their council.</p>
			        	<p>This more than anything began to convince the world that The Occupation was threatening everything we knew in this land. After the Great Goron Abdication, the races fell before the Hylians like dominos. In less than a season they had nearly achieved what they'd set out to do since falling from the sky, complete control and subjugation of Termina and its residents. Everyone except the Gerudo and Sheikah had fallen and bent the knee to the Hylian King, but they would soon follow suit.</p>
			        	<p>However, the future may not be so bleak. The Gorons never leftus, they are still here, we just have to need them more to get to them. And some believe that the day is coming when they will return to give us their wisdom once more. The Ancient Goron Prophecy speaks of a Goron Hero that will rise from the bonds of slavery and help beat back the Hylian oppression that had for ages kept his people from playing their rightful role in the world. The Giants are Good if this prophecy is true, and we can only hope that the future will vindicate us this way.</p>

		        	<div class="sheikah">
		        		<h1>Enslaved, Bowed, Broken</h1>
			        	<h2>The Sheikah: A Once Proud Race Beaten So Low They Have to Serve Their Enemy For Eternity</h2>
			        	<p>Before the Hylians arrived, the Sheikah had always been like Termina's police force. Stealthy, deadly, and intelligent, they were the perfect race to enforce whatever rules and judgements the Gorons passed down. But when the Hylians arrived, the Sheikah were the first to confront them and tell them that they were acting in ways that violated the eons long Terminian order. The Sheikah were quick to return, announcing a truce. The Hylians would only take a small portion of the fertile lands, like all the other races do, but would be housed among the other tribes as they saw fit until a proper home could open itself up to us. This is the manner with which Termina has greeted all new races to its land since its founding, but it only bought us a short peace before the Hylians started to change the way things worked.</p>
			        	<p>Despite the agreement, the Hylians continued to build new settlements outside their boundaries in the fertile lands. At first it was accepted as them finding their feet here and needing a little breathing room for expansion. But after a few seasons It became evident that the settlements would never stop until the Hylians had taken it all.</p>
			        	<p>In response, the Sheikah sent one of their elite agents to treat with the Hylians, but was instead ambushed by a delegation from the Gerudo Tribe. Apparently, the current Gerudo King was rather weak and afraid to enter into conflict due to some mistakes of his predecessor damaging the Gerudo name. This delegation informed the Sheikah that the Gerudo and Hylians had entered into an agreement that would give both their tribes a large increase in their portion of the fertile lands. The Sheikah agent was infuriated and returned to warn his people that they would have to take up arms against both the Gerudo and the Hylians at once if they were to act against either one. It was around this time when the Gorons went into hiding. The Sheikah decided to go it alone anyway, to do what was right, and ignore the Gerudo truce, believing that they were too cowardly to fight if they did in fact attack the Hylians.</p>
			        	<p>But fight, unfortunately, they did. While the King was afraid to send his people to war, his people were starved for some of their former glory and tired of being scolded for the mistakes of the previous decade. The Gerudo military was more than ready to fight and with their help, the Hylian army nearly ended the Sheikah line.</p>
			        	<p>A group of four Sheikah, two male, two female, were left alive at the end of the battle. They were taken prisoner by the Hylian Army and sent to see their King. No one knows what happened to the there, only that after a season they emerged, and announced that they had been wrong about the Hylians and would prove it by devoting their race's line to the care and development of the Hylian Royalty. To this day, only one Sheikah is born for every princess, out of fear that the bloodline will degrade too fast if breeding is left unchecked, seeing as how their entire race now springs from only four individuals. Some speculate that the Hylians gave the Sheikah a choice, join us or be destroyed. A common theme you'll see throughout the history of The Occupation.</p>

		        	<div class="gerudo">
			        	<h1>The Stain of History</h1>
			        	<h2>The Gerudo: How a Historical Tragedy Paints an Entire People Blindly</h2>
			        	<p>After the Fall of the Sheikah, the Gerudo Tribe was the last hope for Terminians to escape The Occupation. The Gerudo were strong, had a strong national identity, and lots of experience in military and territorial affairs. The previous Gerudo King had been so strong and warlike that it took a Sheikah intervention to dethrone him, give back the territory he had illegally seized, and give the throne to his son. But now, under his rule, the Gerudo had become weak and lazy, less feared and respeceted. But when they were the last men standing, the world looked to them, pact with the Hylians or not.</p>
			        	<p>And this pact was a sham, to be sure. It was hardly a complete moon from the time the Sheikah changed over before the Hylians were upon the Gerudo. Some say it was a grudge that went back to before The Exile, when Hylians lived in Termina with their Goddess to protect them, but others believe it was just good military planning. Within days it was over. The whole of GErudo Valley was in Hylian hands and the Gerudo King was all too happy to bend the knee in return for his life and the illusion of control over his people.</p>
			        	<p>The Gerudo suffered because they were painted as warlike because of a century of aggression brought on by a vicious King. They were not allowed to act as they would because of fear of being thought like their predecessors. Does that sound familiar? Any living Gerudo will tell you that it is worse today than it ever was in that age. After the crimes and fall of King Ganondorf way back in the era of The Imprisoning War, Gerudo today suffer the same problems and prejudice but even more amplified. Many across Termina, even those educated in Hylian misinformation, still mistakenly believe that the Gerudo is a shiftless untrustworthy race, full of tricks, deceit, and evil. This campaign benefits only the Hylians. In fact, the Gerudo may be our strongest allies in the fight against their oppression. Before the Age of "Hyrule", The Gerudo were one of the most revered and respected, not withstanding powerful, races in the land. The Hylians worked long and hard to create this image to weaken their ability to stop The Occupation.</p>

		        	<div class="kokiri">
			        	<h1>A Stolen Legacy</h1>
			        	<h2>The Kokiri: How a Small Simple People Stood Up to the Hylian Lies and Paid Dearly</h2>
			        	<p>Part of the Canon of our world is the story of the Hero of Time. As the Hylians tell it, a Hylian child courageously faced off against the All-Powerful Demon King Ganon, once the King of the Gerudo, Ganondorf. This story is known to even small children in Termina as the events of the Hero of greatly shaped the laws, order, and balance of power in the land. The story ends with the Hero imprisoning Ganon in the Sacred Realm which allowed the Hylians to later obtain the complete Triforce for themselves.</p>
			        	<p>Everyone knows that The Hero was Hylian. Everyone knows that he wore green and had a fairy. And everyone also knows that the hero was just a child. Does this sound strange to you? When have you ever seen a Hylian wear green that way, either now or in the Hylian historical scrolls? Why would a Hylian have a fairy companion? No one asks these questions any more. Why? Because they don't even know why they should be asked, since the complete destruction and eventual extincion of the Kokiri race has made it too easy to forget.</p>
			        	<p>The Kokiri was a race that came from the forest. Children of the Forest they were called, due to the fact that they didn't age and stayed children for as long as they lived, which often reached several hundred years old. One thing that was very particular, even characteristic of the Kokiri tribe was the peculiar style of green clothing they wore. Yes, exactly consistent with the style of dress all known depictions of the Hero of Time adhere to. Another fact about the Kokiri tribe is that each Kokiri was born with a fairy friend or companion to follow them on their life's journey. Exactly like the fairy the Hero of Time was said to have following him around. And that is the most conclusive evidence of all, since even the Kokiri themseleves considered how and why they were given their fairies to be one of their race's greatest mysteries. If the Hero was not a Kokiri how did he get a fairy?</p>
			        	<p>The official story is that The Hero was a Hylian child whose mother escaped the last battle against the Gerudo, her village having been in the path of the Gerudo Soldiers fleeing the valley after the invasion, and placed her son in the care of the Kokiri. A story that one could possibly believe, except for the fact that the Kokiri refuted it from day one. One Kokiri famed outside of the forest named Mido was very vocal and led the charge that the Kokiri not be denied their place in history as the tribe of the Hero of Time. No matter what the Hylians did to try and combat his claims, Mido always had evidence, witnesses or more to refute the Hylian refutations. The battle of the heritage of the Hero was a disaster for the Hylian cause. While they had already consolidated their power that it was no real threat, claiming that the Hero himself was Hylian led to a feeling of resignation about their place in the world being their "rightful" place. As long as the Kokiri were laying claim to the Hero's race there would always be doubt in the other Terminians' minds about the Hylians' divine charge to rule us all.</p>
			        	<p>For awhile the Hylians let the battle play out on the street, letting the people decide, hoping they could win with the same bullying and misinformation tactics they were already famous for. But teh Kokiri were just to pure of an enemy to fight that way. Compared to the Hylians, the Kpkiri seemed regal, dignified, righteous. Every piece of evidence pointed to their claim being true and their demeanor just made it seem even more right that they would be the ones telling the truth. Accounts from many different tribes describe what happened next in very different ways, but one thing is clear, the Hylians decided to stop fighting an image war with an enemy they couldn't best and do what they DID know how to do well... Fight.</p>
			        	<p>Hylian soldiers began gathering closer and closer to the edges of Kokiri forest. The Kokiri elders realized what must be happening and urged Mido and the rest of the Truthers behind the Hero to stop their claims, true or not, for the good of their entire race. However, they did not do this. Mido led a band of Kokiri to throw pine cones and flash seeds at the solider from the tops of the trees in the hopes that they would chase them off and teach them a lesson for coming so close to Kokiri land. 37 Kokiri were killed, including Mido himself, and the Truther movement scattered and fled to tell the rest of the world what had happened.</p>
			        	<p>But there was nothing more to be done, the Hylians had already moved in, using the confrontation as an excuse to put the forest on lockdown. As the Hylian soldiers invaded, the Kokiri tried to repel them, considering it sacrilege to let them walk through their forest unchecked. Every living Kokiri was slaughtered, and the Great Deku Tree cut down and turned into a Hylian outpost for the Army. The Hylians planned to take the forest for themselves, establishing a forest branch of the military, trained in the special flora that only grew in the sacred protection of the Kokiri Woods. However, the Woods themselves had another idea. Just as they were finishing up the outpost, they noticed strange trees that didn't seem to be there before. Every day, the trees would change, appearing to get closer. One day, a brave Hylian soldier went to see what was going on and came back a Stalfos. What had happened was, the Lost Woods themselves, in an effort to repel the invaders, and grown to encircle the Hylian outpost so that there was no way to go in or out without going through the Lost Woods. And as every Kokiri child knew, any Hylian that enters without the right guide will end up a Stalfos.</p>
			        	<p>The Hylians gave up on the Forest Branch of the military and abandonded that outpost almost immediately. They had done what they needed to do, which was to silence the Truther movement about the Hero, and rather than discredit, completely obliterate the entire bloodline of the race that dared to endanger the sanctity of their divine status as the Chosen Rulers of this world.</p>

			        	<h1>Out of Sight</h1>
			        	<h2>The Deku Scrubs: The Marginalization and Abuse of Deku Scrubs Throughout the Kingdom</h2>
			        	<p>After the Hylians had established their dominance over Termina and built the crown jewel of The Occupation, Hyrule Castle as well as the town surrounding it, they were faced with a new problem. Deku Scrubs, generally thought to be somewhat of an annoyance, soon became a major problem for the Hylians. If you are not familiar with Deku Scrub culture, you have to understand that Deku Scrubs are somewhat nomadic. They live anywhere and everywhere that they are capable of digging into the ground enough to make a home. Usually this isn't a problem for most Terminians, as typically new structures and buildings as so small as to not interfere with Deku Scrub life.</p>
			        	<p>If someone builds something overtop a Deku Scrub's home, the Scrub will just usually just dig themselves a new way out and start using that as an entrance to their underground home. But when the Hylians broke ground on Hyrule Castle, the space was so great and the number of stones laid down so numerous that there were dozens maybe hundreds of Deku Scrubs hopelessly covered up by the foundations of Hyrule Castle.</p>
			        	<p>Some of them managed to escape, digging for miles until they were clear of the construction area. Many more were unable to. See, unlike a typical structure being built, this construction was so vast, so encompassing, that it completely covered their entire homes for a long distance, not just blocking a single way in or out. Deku Scrubs can dig deep and fast, but they can't do it for long periods of time. That's why when multiple Deku Scrubs nest close to each other, they will eventually join tunnels, creating a new Deku Scrub community. If more and more Scrubs join it will become a vast colony of Deku Scrubs life with a series of tunnels and open spaces linking the different Dekus' homes. But it takes them years and years to build something like this. One Deku Scrub is only capable of digging for a short time, and even with a whole population working toward it, it can take months just to dig a chamber big enough to be considered a public meeting space for the Deku.</p>
			        	<p>And what the Hylians may not have known at the time (or if they did know, calculatingly planned) was that "Hyrule" Castle was directly overtop the single most complex and sophisticated Deku civilization in all of Termina. In laying the foundation for their castle there, they all but ensured the elimination of a large part of the Deku Population, and left homeless a great number more. By the time the final stone was laid, dozens of Deku Scrubs were living in the grounds surrounding the castle and asking each passing Hylian for help or rupees. Needless to say, the Hylians would never let their precious new castle be marred with the presence of so many "undesirables" as they were called at the time, in order to not make it look like the Hylians were battling against the natural order of YET ANOTHER race of Terminians. But the Hylian King had no idea what could be done with them.</p>
			        	<p>Unlike most of the races in Termina, The Deku Scrub race is a little less amenable to outsiders telling them what to do. They have never recognized a single King, Giant, or Goddess in the time they've been living in Termina. The Deku Scrubs are apart from it all in a way that allows them to be an honest beacon of Terminian values, unsullied by the whims and agendas of those seeking power. The Hylians didn't know this at first, of course, and they tried to send troops in to collect and re-locate the Deku Scrubs who were hanging around the castle, but they would just launch blinding seeds at the troops from afar and dive underground whenever they got near enough to attack. After a few embarrassing and failed attempts to muscle the Deku Scrubs, the Hylians tried to treat with them. Which was also a comedy of errors, since the Deku Scrubs honor no King among them, the Hylian treatise to meet and negotiate with the Hylian King was interpreted as every Deku Scrub was welcome to join. And that's exactly what happened, almost every living Deku Scrub in Termina showed up at the Throne Room, ready to treat with the Hylian King.</p>
			        	<p>Needless to say the Hylian King was incensed. He thought that this was at best an attempt to humiliate him and make him look foolish, at worst a show of force and might to march on the throne room so easily. The Hylian King sent his troops to secure the Throne Room, and a small scuffle turned into a slaughter with hundreds of Deku Scrubs killed and dozens of Hylians wounded. The remaining Deku Scrubs fled the city and for the first time in their history, decided to act as a race, declaring the Hylians mortal enemies, and they vowed to stay on the fringes, biding their time to act, and in the meantime doing anything and everything in their power to pick at the edges of the Hylian empire, doing small damage whenever and wherever it was possible.</p>
			        	<p>To this day a handful of Deku Scrubs will take up residence in any settlement the Hylians establish. They are good citizens, obeying the Hylian rules and ways of life as much as a Deku Scrub can, but still waiting and watching for the day when the Deku Scrubs can take back what was once theirs, both in land and diginity. In retaliation, the Hylians started the narrative that the Deku Scrubs were in fact Monsters From Below, tricksters not to be trusted or dealt with in any capacity. This idea of Deku Scrubs still stands, and it's done a lot of damage to the Deku Scrub culture, with many races still thinking of them as less than, more monster than intelligent being, some like the Gerudo, even killiing them with impunity like pests. This could not be further from the truth. The Deku Scrubs have a rich and vibrant culture like every other race in Termina and desrve the same dignity and respect that we want.

			        	<h1>Chaos Personified</h1>
			        	<h2>The Moblins: Often Thought a "Monster" These Creatures Bring a Lokian Balance to Termina</h2>
			        	<p>One Temrinian race that most people never talk about when talking about freedom for its people are the Moblins. In fact a great number of Terminians believe that Moblins aren't one of us anyway, assuming due to their loyalty to Ganondorf, that they are monsters that came from below. But in fact, Moblins were one of the first races of Termina and also one of the most important.</p>
			        	<p>Moblins were one of the first life forms to roam the pristine fields of Termina after The Giants laid the foundations. In the book of Chaos, the Giant Gof explains how the first races of Termina were created to uphold a balance and how the Moblins completed the chaotic side of a very important equation in the populations of Termina. Almost every other race was imbued with a higher level of intelligence and a strong need for order. So much so that it was an imbalance in the Giants' design. In order to counter all the structure and beauty The Giants imbued in the other races, the Moblins had to be created to keep a "wild card" in the deck in some way. But just because this is what the Giants had intended doesn't mean the Hylians would be bound to respect it.</p>
			        	<p>After the Scattering of the Deku Tribes, the Moblins made the top of the Hylians' list of annoyances to handle on their way to complete cultural supremacy. For the longest time, the Hylians just treated the Moblins like beasts, ignoring them or slaughtering them just for fun. It got bad for them to the point that   when Ganondorf began to gather power he seemed to be the right side to join if they ever wanted to be respected, protected, or left to live their lives in peace. And even though history (well, at least HYLIAN history) has proven him wrong, every time he has returned, the Moblins also flock to his side. They cannot be swayed or told how evil he is.  They just understand their experiences, and Ganondorf in any of his forms has never slaughtered Moblins by the hundreds like the Hylians have. But whenever Ganon falls, they go back to their peaceful, if somewhat trickster-y, ways, like the Giants always intended.</p>

		        	<img src="images/fakeears.jpg" alt="Hylian Ears" />
		        	<p>Hylians claim their ridiculous pointy ears allow them to "hear the messages of the gods". A convenient way to tell someone else to do what you want, for sure, but you don't have to be left out any longer! Get Pointy Ears and now you can hear what the Gods are saying too. Infused with a secret Hylian magic, each set of pointy ears lets you not only look cool, but boss everyone around while you do it.</p>
		        	<p>Available in Zora, Gerudo, and Deku Scrub. Goron model coming soon!</p>

		        	<p>No question, Ganondorf was a bad bad guy, but even though his methods were extreme you might be surprised that he wasn't only motivated by evil.</p>
		        	<p>In <i>Rise of Ganon</i> famed Gerudo filmmaker Aveil Bastille explores the real reasons behind Ganondorf's quest to conquer Hyrule and the undiscovered truth behind why everything went so wrong in the end. While Hylian apologists would lead you to believe that their "Hero" was doing what needed to be done to "save the world" <i>Rise of Ganon</i> will point to questions that will haunt you, leading you to consider if maybe everything you've been told is a lie.</p>
		        	<p>Check out the premiere during the next Festival of Time, in Clock Town, Gerudo Valley, and at the hidden outpost at the remains of the old Kokiri Forest.</p>
