			        	<h1>A Land of Ice and Water</h1>
			        	<h2>The Zoras: The Taking of the Lake and Relocation to their "Domain"</h2>
			        	<p>One of the most prominant features of Occupied Termina is the grand and majestic sight of Lake Hylia. A namesake of its people, the Lake is a proud symbol of the life, fertility, and beauty these Golden Lands of Termina have to offer. But as you may have wondered, the Hylians are not an aquatic race, nor are they especially fearsome or skilled on the water. How and why then does this Great Lake bear their name?</p>
			        	<p>It may not surprise you to learn that before the Occupation, the Lake was not called Lake Hylia, but in fact, Lake Zora. It was the crown jewel of Zora culture. It is a beauty now to be seen, but in its height, the Zoras had outdone themselves in displaying the sleek sophistication and advanced aquatic technology their people were famed for. A vast city complex ran throughout the entire lake and even extend above in places, so that visitors from the land could enter and see the city from the inside. So famed, lush, and gorgeous a place, Lake Zora was a sight travelers came from leagues away to see. So famed, that it was almost immediately made a target by the Hylians when they descended upon the land and calling everything that was long there before them, theirs.</p>
			        	<p>When the Hylians returned from the sky, they came from every corner of the land, falling from the sky like some kind of gift or perhaps pestilence from The Giants. The Zoras were one of the races that fought them the hardest, having an aptitude and strong drive for warfare. Also, at that moment, the Zora culture was on an upswing and everywhere they were beginning to assert a little more dominence, trying to show off in from of all the other races with their grandeur. But even the Zoras were no match for the Hylians, aided as they were with the might of the Triforce. The Zoras retreated to Lake Zora and prepared to make their last stand.</p>
			        	<p>The Hylian generals had decided to take the Lake City as a prize and warning to the other races that were openly defying their Occupation of their lands. Meanwhile, the entire Zora force fell back and fortified the city preparing for a massive showdown. And they were not disappointed. Hylian forces surrounded the lake with a force so large the Zoras had never seen anything like it. They prepared to fight when the Hylians offered peace for the Zoras if they would just relocate to a small sanctuary the Hylians had discovered not far from the central settlement. Of course the Zoras ignored this and prepared for battle.</p>
			        	<p>And when the battle begun, The Zoras believed they had a chance to defend their proud city, their citadel of culture, the pride of their peoples' accomplishments. But as the battle began, the Hylians didn't attack the Zoras rushing at them, they fought just to destroy the infrastructure of the town itself. Before long the foundations began to creak and the entire Lake Zora city collapsed, killing over 80% of the Zora population, most of them non-fighting civilians, females, or eggs.</p>
			        	<p>In the face of such brutality the Zoras immediately surrendered, placing themselves at the Hylians' mercy, fully expecting to receive none. However, they were surpirsed. The Hylians kept their word honoring the original deal, transporting the remaining Zora population to this small outcropping of water near the site of the future Hyrule Castle, thus establishing their home at "Zora's Domain". And while it seems like an honorable way to treat an enemy, Zora historians later noted that the resources needed by the original Zora population was more than four times what would have been possible under the best of conditions in Zora's domain. Either the Hylians had planned to level the city anyway, thus reducing the population to a level where it was possible to survive in The Domain. Or, they had just planned to let them starve each other out, fighting for what resources were available. Either way, the Hylians at no time had any plans to allow for the possibility of peace with the Zoras, only content with eliminating them as a threat and competition, while also keeping them close enough to look after in a place where it would be impossible for their numbers to grow too big.</p>

			        	<h1>Once and Future Guardians</h1>
			        	<h2>The Gorons: The Role They Once Played and Why They Will Again</h2>
			        	<p>Before the Hylian Occupation, there was a different system of law and order in Termina. The Gorons, a race much stronger, but slower, steadier, and with an inherent sense fo justice, had always stood up for the rights and welfare of others since the beginnings of Termina itself. In fact, some believe that the first Goron was in fact a descendant of one of the Four Giants. And before The Occupation, that is what they did. The Gorons were judges, adjucating disagreements between people, tribes, and races. Many wars were averted thanks to the wisdom and counsel of the Great Goron Council.</p>
			        	<p>However, when the Hylians began to spread across the land, not even the Gorons were able to settle and treat with them. The head Goron Judge at the time was recorded as saying, "We can no longer do that which we've done for time immemorial, these Hylians will not listen to anyone but their own." And it wasn't long after that the Gorons sent word to every tribe taht they would no longer be playing a role in Terminian Society and would retreat for their own species preservation to Death Mountain, where only the most courageous would be able to find them and seek their council.</p>
			        	<p>This more than anything began to convince the world that The Occupation was threatening everything we knew in this land. After the Great Goron Abdication, the races fell before the Hylians like dominos. In less than a season they had achieved what they'd set out to do since falling from the sky, complete control and subjucation of Termina and its residents. Everyone except the Gerudo had fallen and bent the knee to the Hylian King, but the Gerudo were allied with Hylians and despite their obvious warlike intentions, the Gerudo seemed unable or unwilling to stop them.</p>
			        	<p>However, the future may not be so bleak. The Gorons never leftus, they are still here, we just have to need them more to get to them. And some believe that the day is coming when they will return to give us their wisdom once more. The Ancient Goron Prophecy speaks of a Goron Hero that will rise from the bonds of slavery and help beat back the Hylian oppression that had for ages kept his people from playing their rightful role in the world. The Giants are Good if this prophecy is true, and we can only hope that the future will vindicate us this way.</p>

		        	<p>No question, Ganondorf was a bad bad guy, but even though his methods were extreme you might be surprised that he wasn't only motivated by evil.</p>
		        	<p>In <i>Rise of Ganon</i> famed Gerudo filmmaker Aveil Bastille explores the real reasons behind Ganondorf's quest to conquer Hyrule and the undiscovered truth behind why everything went so wrong in the end. While Hylian apologists would lead you to believe that their "Hero" was doing what needed to be done to "save the world" <i>Rise of Ganon</i> will point to questions that will haunt you, leading you to consider if maybe everything you've been told is a lie.</p>
