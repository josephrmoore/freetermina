		        	<p>You hear their lies everywhere, but have you ever found yourself at a loss to explain to a Hylian exactly why you believe what you believe without getting tripped up in these lies?</p>
		        	<p>Worry no longer! Each issue of What THEY Say takes a razor sharp look at the ridiculous lies the Hylians tell to try and win this war with misinformation.</p>

		        	<p>Hylians claim their ridiculous pointy ears allow them to "hear the messages of the gods". A convenient way to tell someone else to do what you want, for sure, but you don't have to be left out any longer! Get Pointy Ears and now you can hear what the Gods are saying too. Infused with a secret Hylian magic, each set of pointy ears lets you not only look cool, but boss everyone around while you do it.</p>

		        	<p>No question, Ganondorf was a bad bad guy, but even though his methods were extreme you might be surprised that he wasn't only motivated by evil.</p>
		        	<p>In <i>Rise of Ganon</i> famed Gerudo filmmaker Aveil Bastille explores the real reasons behind Ganondorf's quest to conquer Hyrule and the undiscovered truth behind why everything went so wrong in the end. While Hylian apologists would lead you to believe that their "Hero" was doing what needed to be done to "save the world" <i>Rise of Ganon</i> will point to questions that will haunt you, leading you to consider if maybe everything you've been told is a lie.</p>
		        	<p>Check out the premiere during the next Festival of Time, in Clock Town, Gerudo Valley, and at the hidden outpost at the remains of the old Kokiri Forest.</p>
